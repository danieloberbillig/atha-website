                        <p>
                            A total of 640 people completed the survey. 436 (68.1%) were community Interest (not
                            currently
                            living in
                            cities); 156 (24.4%) lived in tiny houses; 14 (2.2%) owned a tiny house and rented it
                            out; and
                            34
                            (5.3%)
                            were tiny house builders (but did not live in one).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of community interest (i.e. not tiny house builders, dwellers etc), the majority (82.1%)
                            wished
                            to
                            live
                            in a tiny house one day and 15.42% wanted to be a tiny house builder (note, respondents
                            could
                            tick
                            more
                            than one in this question). Lesser numbers had interest in tiny houses, were from a
                            community or
                            government organisation or had an interest in sustainable housing.

                        <p>
                            Overall, the majority of respondents not living in tiny houses (community interest) were
                            aged
                            over
                            41
                            (272 or 65.54%); but of those who lived in tiny houses, ages were evenly distributed
                            between
                            15-40;

                            Over ¾ of respondents were female (76.63% or 318 people). This may reflect a greater
                            interest in
                            tiny
                            houses for women, but it may also reflect that more women than men tend to fill in
                            surveys. Tiny
                            house
                            dwellers were mostly couples (64), female only (33) or male (16). A very small
                            proportion (2)
                            identified
                            as non-binary. Approximately 20% had children, one with 4+ but no others with more than
                            21.

                        <p>
                            The majority of tiny houses were on wheels (77.86%), with the rest on foundations
                            (17.14%) or
                            converted
                            caravans (5%).

                        <p>
                            Those with community interest in tiny houses (not living in a tiny house) mostly lived
                            in
                            Victoria,
                            Queensland and NSW (in that order), followed by SA, WA, TAS, NT and ACT. Those living in
                            tiny
                            houses
                            showed the same distribution as community interest, with very few in NT (1) and none in
                            the ACT.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The majority (59%) of tiny houses were located in rural areas (see Table 1), with 24% in
                            backyards,
                            7%
                            on vacant residential blocks, and the remainder (11%) in cluster living arrangements.
                            There was
                            no
                            relationship between type of tiny house and location, age, gender, placement or State,
                            although
                            there
                            were no converted caravans in Victoria or WA (but the number of these overall was very
                            small).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There was a significant relationship between State and location of the tiny house, with
                            no tiny
                            houses
                            on vacant residential blocks in Qld, NSW or the NT (despite the high proportion of tiny
                            houses
                            in
                            Qld
                            and NSW). This may reflect different planning provisions between the States (parking a
                            tiny
                            house on
                            a
                            vacant lot in some councils in Queensland is illegal).

                            Most had not sought council approval for their tiny houses (81.15%). Of those, there was
                            no
                            particular
                            difference in type of tiny house (bearing in mind that the majority were THOW). There
                            was no
                            relationship with age and council approval, although nobody under 25 had sought council
                            approval
                            (of
                            note, there were very few respondents in that category). Interestingly, only 3 of the
                            tiny
                            houses on
                            foundations had sought council approval, and 12 of the THOW had sought council approval.

                            Despite anecdotes (mostly on social media) that a person can build a tiny house for
                            under $20k,
                            most
                            cost more than $26,000, and two cost over $126,000.

                        <p>
                            Whilst the majority (86%) had paid for their tiny houses themselves, contrary to social
                            media
                            anecdotes,
                            a few had financed their tiny houses (mostly as personal loans from banks) and one with

                            RACQ,

                            People sourced their trailers from a variety of sources, predominantly new with a

                            Somewhat
                            disturbingly, over a quarter sourced theirs second-hand, and of those, 8% did not have a

                            plate.

                        <p>
                            Most tiny houses were off grid on solar (47%), another 29% had a mix of solar and mains
                            power
                            and

                            were on mains power. The location of the tiny house had no relationship with the source
                            of
                            power.
                            There
                            were similar proportions for water; with slightly more on tank water only (54%). Another

                            (presumably

                            and

                            Despite the common complaints on social media about loft beds, the majority had a loft
                            bedroom
                            (see
                            Fig.
                            3). This is likely a result of the common tiny house on wheels configuration, that has
                            limited
                            width
                            to
                            ensure the dwelling is road legal.

                            The main drivers given for choosing to live in a tiny house were largely because the
                            respondents
                            were
                            ‘passionate about a smaller footprint or living tiny’ (84 respondents, 70%); for

                            reasons

                            there were a few obvious themes. These could be differentiated into seven major
                            categories;
                            design,
                            council regulations, community, affordability, lifestyle, environment and minimalism.

                        <h2>Design</h2>
                        <p>
                            Many respondents spoke of the importance of design, particularly to be responsive and
                            flexible,
                            yet
                            not
                            to have to be moved around all the time.
                        </p>
                        <p class="citation">Make sure there is flexibility in the design to be able to personalise
                            it to

                            needs.

                        <p>
                            Interestingly, one respondent mentioned that you can design the tiny house exactly to
                            your needs
                            and
                            you
                            don’t have to worry about resale value as in a traditional house, and similar comments
                            were:
                        </p>
                        <p class="citation">Design it with your now and future needs. If this is to be your forever

                        <h2>Council Regulations</h2>
                        <p>Although design had more comments, these were quite diverse, and included aspects of
                            building
                            design.
                            The
                            issue of council regulations on the other hand, had long and detailed comments, mostly
                            around
                            the
                            difficulties that people have had with local councils and their complicated and often
                            confusing
                            regulations. Many people said that they wanted councils to be more proactive with tiny
                            houses,
                            for
                            example:</p>

                            some people to want to live in a tiny house, a less traditional and more alternative
                            housing
                            option.

                        <p>Many reported having problems with councils and often inconsistent and illogical rulings
                            about
                            tiny

                            which
                            vary widely.
                            There should be no reason why a tiny house cannot sit on a piece of land as the only
                            dwelling as
                            long as
                            it meets certain safety codes. Why should it be necessary to have a primary non-THOW
                            dwelling on
                            the
                            land? It's absurd! The non-THOW dwelling could be falling down while the THOW dwelling
                            could be
                            in
                            pristine condition and completely safe. Living in a THOW should not in any way depend on
                            another
                            "permanent" dwelling being on the land. If it's about collecting Council taxes, then tax
                            the

                            Finally, affordability was extremely important, and respondents often mentioned that
                            tiny houses
                            were
                            their only option to have a home of their own.

                        <p>
                            Interest in tiny houses in Australia is very strong, although relatively few people
                            actually
                            live in
                            them. This is likely due to persistent issues around legalisation, as councils are
                            inconsistent
                            and
                            often very inflexible whether they permit tiny houses, particularly tiny houses on
                            wheels. This
                            is
                            highlighted that only 19% of people had sought council approval for their tiny houses.

                            Tiny houses are found all over Australia but mostly in Victoria, Queensland and NSW.
                            This may
                            reflect
                            the origin of the Australian movement in Victoria, as well as more active social media

                            groups. Mostly
                            older people were interested in tiny houses, but the ages of those actually living in
                            tiny
                            houses
                            were
                            more
                            evenly spread. Women over 55 remained a strong interest group.

                        <p>
                            Most tiny houses cost upwards of $40,000, and while most paid cash, a small proportion
                            had
                            obtained
                            finance
                            (mostly personal loans) to build them. They were constructed either by builders, by the
                            tiny
                            house
                            dweller
                            or a combination of both. Most were off-grid to some extent, and also were built out of
                            recycled
                            or
                            environmentally
                            friendly material.

                        <p>
                            Virtually all tiny house dwellers said that the experience of living in a tiny house was
                            positive
                            and
                            met
                            their
                            expectations. The written comments stressed the importance of community, lifestyle,
                            environment
                            and
                            downsizing,
                            and that living in a tiny house freed people from debt and chores. A large proportion of
                            respondents
                            wished
                            to
                            live in some sort of community or tiny house village, often on a property with a number
                            of tiny
                            houses
                            in a
                            multi-generational arrangement. Affordability was also important, although many of the
                            would-be
                            tiny
                            house
                            dwellers felt that they could not get into a tiny house until council regulations were
                            clarified.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overall, tiny houses appear to provide promise to increase urban density without major
                            impact on
                            neighbourhood
                            character; allow those who cannot afford a house to have their own home; and to improve
                            environmental
                            sustainability. Most councils are behind the times and should be more proactive in
                            permitting
                            tiny
                            houses in
                            their jurisdictions, possibly with some sort of permit and fee arrangement.
